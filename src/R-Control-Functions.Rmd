### Control Structures

Control structures are fundamental to all programming and scripting
languages. They allow control over the flow of how code is executed. The
primary control structures in R are: `if`, `else`, `ifelse`, `for`,
`while`.

#### if, else and ifelse

The general syntax for an if statement is

```r
if (condition is TRUE){
  execute this code
}
```

We can add an else condition to this

```r
if (condition is TRUE){
  execute this code
}
else{
  do this
}
```

#### for loops

The general syntax of for loops is

```r
for (index in vectorValues){
  execute this code
}
```

It is possible to have nested for loops

#### while loops

The general syntax for while loops is

```r
while (condition is TRUE){
  execute this code
}
```

Be careful to avoid infinite loops! Loops in R can be slow, and many
tasks can be executed using the `apply` functions.

#### apply, lapply, tapply, mapply
