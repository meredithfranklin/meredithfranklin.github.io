Through teaching statistics courses at USC over the past few years, I
have amassed a significant amount of instructional R code, from
introductory statistics to advanced spatial modeling.

I am in the process of organizing all of this code into a set of
tutorials and will be gradually publishing it through this site. You can
see the table of contents on the left sidebar. Some of the links are
empty -- this is a work in progress!

I've written most of this site using
[Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) and
[R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
(with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)),
and am hosting it through [GitHub pages.](https://pages.github.com/)
